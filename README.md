# Description
This repository will keep track of all the Visual Studio snippets I am using. The main purpose is to have it maintained in a structured manner but it also might be useful for others.

I use VS 2017 and for now this is the only version I can confirm these snippets do as expected. Later I might consider checking compatibility.
