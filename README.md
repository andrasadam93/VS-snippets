# Description
This repository will keep track of all the Visual Studio snippets I am using. The main purpose is to have it maintained in a structured manner but it also might be useful for others.

## Version compatibility
I use VS 2017 and for now this is the only version I can confirm these snippets do as expected. Later I might consider checking compatibility.

## Adding to Visual Studio
For now I will be lazy and just add the official documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet?#import-a-code-snippet

Also, the distribution of these snippets would later transfer to its proper way, as described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-distribute-code-snippets
